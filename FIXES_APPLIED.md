# Fixes Applied - Language Detection Issue

## Problem Identified

The extension was **blindly toggling** between languages when Alt+Shift was pressed, but it had **no way to know what the actual OS keyboard language was**. This caused a desync:

- User's actual keyboard: Hebrew
- Extension thinks: English
- Result: Wrong language remembered for tabs

## Root Cause

The extension was using a **toggle logic** (`hebrew → english → hebrew`) based on its own memory, but:
1. It didn't know the initial state when Chrome starts
2. If user pressed Alt+Shift outside of a webpage, extension missed it
3. No detection of what language user is ACTUALLY typing in

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Real-Time Language Detection from Typed Characters**
Location: [content.js:332-366](content.js#L332-366)

**What it does:**
- Every time user types a character, detect if it's Hebrew or English
- If detected language doesn't match what we think it is → **CORRECT our understanding**
- Update background with the actual language

**Example:**
```
Extension thinks: english
User types: ע (Hebrew character)
Extension detects: MISMATCH! User is actually in hebrew!
Extension corrects: currentLanguage = 'hebrew'
```

### 2. **Enhanced Logging for Debugging**
Added comprehensive logs:
- Language mismatch detection with big warning boxes
- State tracking on every action
- Buffer tracking to see typed characters

### 3. **Re-sync on Tab Visibility**
Location: [content.js:615-622](content.js#L615-622)

When you switch back to a tab, it re-queries the background to get the current language state.

### 4. **Debug Console Commands**
Location: [content.js:624-656](content.js#L624-656)

Added `window.autoLangDebug` with commands:
- `autoLangDebug.getCurrentLanguage()` - See current language
- `autoLangDebug.setLanguage('hebrew')` - Manually set language
- `autoLangDebug.showState()` - See full state

### 5. **Improved State Synchronization**
- Content script properly receives language updates from background on tab switch
- Background sends `setLanguage` message (not just indicator) when tab switches
- Retry logic for initial language query

## How to Test

### Step 1: Reload Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find AutoLang
3. Click "Reload" button
4. **Important:** Refresh (F5) all open tabs to reload content scripts

### Step 2: Open Test Page
Open: `file:///C:/Users/YonatanSetbon/Downloads/AutoLang_WITH_LOGGING/AutoLang/test.html`

### Step 3: Open Consoles
1. **Page console:** Press F12 on test page
2. **Background console:** Go to `chrome://extensions/` → AutoLang → click "service worker"

### Step 4: Test Flow

**A. Test Initial State Detection:**
1. Open test page
2. In console, type: `autoLangDebug.getCurrentLanguage()`
3. Should show: `english` (default)

**B. Test Typing Detection (CRITICAL):**
1. Click in the "Name" field
2. Type English letters: `hello`
3. Check console - should NOT show mismatch (already in english)
4. Press Alt+Shift to switch to Hebrew
5. Type Hebrew letters: `שלום`
6. **If extension thought you were in English**, you should see:
   ```
   ╔════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
   ║ [AutoLang Content] LANGUAGE MISMATCH DETECTED  ║
   ║ We thought language was: english               ║
   ║ But user typed: hebrew                         ║
   ║ → CORRECTING OUR UNDERSTANDING                 ║
   ╚════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
   ```
7. Extension now knows you're in Hebrew!

**C. Test Tab Switching:**
1. In test page (Tab A), type Hebrew letters to set language to Hebrew
2. Check badge shows: עב
3. Open a new tab (Tab B) - google.com
4. Type English letters in search box
5. Check badge shows: EN
6. **Switch back to Tab A**
7. Watch background console - should trigger keyboard switch to Hebrew
8. Watch page console - should update language to Hebrew

**D. Test Manual Correction:**
If extension is wrong, manually correct it:
```javascript
autoLangDebug.setLanguage('hebrew')  // or 'english'
```

## Expected Behavior Now

✅ Extension detects actual typed language in real-time
✅ Self-corrects when mismatch is detected
✅ Logs all corrections for debugging
✅ Badge shows correct language
✅ Tab switching triggers correct keyboard layout
✅ Debug commands available for manual testing

## Debugging Tips

### Check What Extension Thinks
```javascript
autoLangDebug.showState()
```

### Check Background State
In background console:
```
[AutoLang] ═══ DEBUG STATE ═══
```

### See Mismatch Logs
Look for big box warnings in page console when typing.

### Check Badge
The badge (עב/EN) should always match what you're actually typing.

## Still Having Issues?

Check these:
1. **AutoHotkey running?** Check system tray for AutoLangWatcher
2. **Downloads folder correct?** Check `AutoLangWatcher.ahk` line 11
3. **Alt+Shift shortcut?** Windows Settings → Time & Language → Language → check keyboard shortcut
4. **Extension context invalidated?** Refresh the page (F5)
5. **Logs show errors?** Share the background console and page console logs

## Key Improvement

**Before:** Extension blindly toggled, could get out of sync
**After:** Extension DETECTS what you're typing and self-corrects automatically ✓
